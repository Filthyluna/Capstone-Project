# Capstone project Requirements
# You **must** use node and/or yarn in order to run the application locally.
# Steps for node js installation:
1. Install latest version of node if you do not already have it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. In command line or git bash within the project folder run this command: 
```
npm install -g npm
```
3. Then install axios using your terminal: 
```
npm install axios
```
4. Run the application with this command: 
```
npm start
```

# Steps for yarn installation:
1. If you already have node and npm you can install it with this command: 
```
npm install --global yarn
```
2. Then run the yarn command in the terminal within the project folder: 
```
yarn
```
3. Install axios using yarn: 
```
yarn add axios
```
4. Run the application with : 
```
yarn start
```

# Troubleshooting:
When you clone the project and do either yarn start or npm start there may be an error with missing react scripts. In order to install it use these commands for yarn and npm respectively:

```
npm i react-scripts
```

```
yarn add react-scripts or yarn add â€“exact react-scripts@5.0.1
```
